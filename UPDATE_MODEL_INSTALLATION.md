# üîß Claude: Update INSTALLATION.md for Embedding, Reranking, and Cross-Encoder Models

You are instructed to **update the INSTALLATION.md file** for the Tyra MCP project to reflect **explicit user-driven model downloads** and to ensure full, correct installation steps for:

- **Embedding models**
- **Reranking models**
- **Cross-encoder models**

---

## üì¶ REQUIREMENTS

1. **Do NOT download or load models automatically in code.**
   - Instead, users must manually download and place models in the expected paths.
   - Document all model names and download URLs.

2. **Update the Prerequisites section** of `INSTALLATION.md` to include:
   - Minimum GPU/CPU requirements for embeddings
   - RAM/storage required for models
   - HuggingFace login (if needed)
   - Git LFS (if any models require it)

3. **Add a "Model Installation" section** with these clear subsections:

---

## ‚úÖ A. Embedding Models

- Recommended: `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
- Alternative: `intfloat/e5-small-v2` for multilingual
- Fallback: `paraphrase-MiniLM-L3-v2`

```bash
# Example command
huggingface-cli download sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2
```

Specify expected download location in config or document instructions to place the model in `./models/embeddings/`.

---

## ‚úÖ B. Cross-Encoder Models (for Reranking)

- Recommended: `cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2`
- Alternative: `cross-encoder/stsb-roberta-base`
- Fallback: `cross-encoder/nli-deberta-v3-base`

```bash
huggingface-cli download cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2
```

Place into `./models/cross-encoders/`. Mention format expected by loader.

---

## ‚úÖ C. Reranking Configuration

If you're using a reranker pipeline (e.g., TopK + rerank), clearly show where reranker config lives in `config.yaml` or `.env`.

Include example JSON or YAML config like:

```yaml
reranking:
  use_cross_encoder: true
  model_path: ./models/cross-encoders/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2
  threshold: 0.7
  top_k: 5
```

---

## üß™ D. Testing Model Installation

Add a section for users to test each model:

```bash
python scripts/test_embedding_model.py
python scripts/test_cross_encoder.py
```

Include these test scripts if not already present.

---

## üí° Other Notes

- If using `sentence-transformers` or `transformers`, mention correct versions in requirements.txt
- Make sure model loading errors are handled gracefully in code
- Mention offline environments and how to use local models without HuggingFace API

---

## ‚ùå DO NOT

- Do not hardcode model URLs in code.
- Do not skip fallback model support.
- Do not leave instructions vague or incomplete.

---

## üéØ GOAL

Ensure Tyra MCP is 100% operational with embeddings, rerankers, and cross-encoders **even in offline or production-secure environments**, with **full clarity** for developers and future contributors.

Update `INSTALLATION.md` accordingly and verify all paths, configs, and steps.
